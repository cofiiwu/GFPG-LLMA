============
Introduction
============
It is the prototype of the paper published on 2019 IEEE Big Data conference.
Title: Fast Frequent Pattern Mining without Candidate Generations on GPU by Low Latency Memory Allocation

========
Building
========
The make file is located in fpgrowth/src/makefile. You must modify some paths.
$> cd fpgrowth/src/
$>make -f makefile

==========================
Block size and load factor
==========================
There are two kernel functions in the program. According to our experiment
results, the block size of kernel_cal_offset dose not affect the performance
significantly. However, the block sizes of kernel_fpg_iter_gtree affect the
performance significantly, and the sizes depend on data sets. 

The load factor also affects the utilization and the scalability of memory.

We list the block sizes and load factors in our experiments for each dataset

Dataset	    	  HASH_LOAD_FACTOR	    Block size

accident		1.3			512
retail			1.0			32
kosarak			1.0			1024
webdoc			1.0			512

Note
========
It is just a prototype, and it was verified by the settings in the paper only.
